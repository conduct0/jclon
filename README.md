# JQ clone in rust

This is a learning project. I started of following along https://blog.davimiku.com/tutorials/json-parsing-rust-1 Now I wanna expand it a bit more, aside from just parsing json. JQ is quite cool so I might try something like that.

- I have to add CLI interface.
- Test with some json docs
- Implement pretty printing
- Queries

## Constraint

- No external dependencies.
- No ai code.
